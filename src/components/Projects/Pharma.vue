<p class="justify-end bg-theme-blue w-6/12 text-dark-beige px-10 py-2 rounded text-xl mb-10 text-center">Build a proof of concept distributed information system with suitable user interfaces that could be used by the FDA, pharmaceutical companies, and participating health care providers to exchange study data as it is produced (i.e., in near real time) in a secure, trusted (i.e., auditable), and controlled (i.e., minimally permissive) manner. Build the information system on top of the Vendia Share platform, which supports data exchange through an immutable, cryptographically verifiable, distributed ledger and provides the primitives to control data flow (e.g., redaction).</p>
